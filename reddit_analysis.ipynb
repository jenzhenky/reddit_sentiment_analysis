       "      <td>Hi everyone,Congratulations to everyone who has been accepted and starting in the fall! That’s awesome. I had some questions about prep courses. I plan on taking the LSAT in September and was wondering if prep courses are worth it. I’d have about 3 months to study. I’ve been going through the books from Powersource that I purchased from a friend, but they don’t seem to be doing a lot for me. I’ve heard a lot about LSATMax, Kaplan, Princeton review, testmasters and so on. I was wondering if any of you had experiences with these online prep courses and what those experiences consisted of. Would one of these make a significant impact in 3 months?Thank you in advance for any advice and light you all can shed on the issue!</td>\n",

That's where their employment numbers come from. UCLA is going to be iffy because CA schools care about GPA more than LSAT, but if you get in it's not a bad option. WashU could be a good option if you get a good scholarship, which you could potentially. I wouldn't do Boston U if you aren't from Boston.I wouldn't go to Davis or Hastings.

       "413     Hello. I was hoping throughout this summer that GRE medians would be released for the handful of schools that accept the GRE; this, however, does not seem to be the case.Is there any hope this info will be released? I saw a couple of HLS admits with GRE scores, but they were all nearly perfect scores and several months ago, so it wasn't incredibly informative.Thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "772     I have all of the PowerScore bibles and I have the PTs 7,9-16,18. I have organized them on an excel sheet by LG type and LR type, which means that I have every question sorted out. However, it would require me flipping through pages if I want to drill. Is it best to just buy the PowerScore questions by type books, even though I have the questions (aprox $150 CAD) or does flipping through pages to drill still work well and provide the benefits of drilling? Looking for some suggestions here, thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

My question is- how come people don't link the UGPA/LSAT search calculator (where you enter GPA and LSAT and it shows you the probability of being admitted) provided on the LSAC website? Isn't that one more comprehensive and representative considering mylsn uses self-reported data?

I am trying to decide whether to apply with these numbers or retake the LSAT.Thanks everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "1468    Anyone heard from the admissions committee at SMU regarding getting off the waitlist? If anyone has any insight on my chances, or advice, I would greatly appreciate it! I know I'm running out of time but its my top school, and I'm willing to do anything. Also, do law schools notify you if you did not make it off the waitlist and into the upcoming class via email, or do they not tell you?

Any advice is welcome!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "2382    I go to LSU for undergrad. I am currently in a summer semester after my junior year, which would place me at a cumulative GPA of around 3.33. I had a horrid gpa my freshman year but every semester has been a 3.5-3.9 since then, and it’s rising about .1 every semester. Best case scenario, I graduate with around a 3.55. I haven’t taken the LSAT, and was planning on taking a year off to work and study for the LSAT. Assuming I do well on the LSAT, even though this is a big range, somewhere from 160-170, where would my options be? I’m in state in Maryland, and I know UMD isn’t the best but it’s certainly not a bad law school. My reach school would probably be UVA (I’m a legacy for the undergrad program, which I doubt has any pull). Where do I stand?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "3215    Hi everyone,Congratulations to everyone who has been accepted and starting in the fall! That’s awesome. I had some questions about prep courses. I plan on taking the LSAT in September and was wondering if prep courses are worth it. I’d have about 3 months to study. I’ve been going through the books from Powersource that I purchased from a friend, but they don’t seem to be doing a lot for me. I’ve heard a lot about LSATMax, Kaplan, Princeton review, testmasters and so on. I was wondering if any of you had experiences with these online prep courses and what those experiences consisted of. Would one of these make a significant impact in 3 months?Thank you in advance for any advice and light you all can shed on the issue!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "3565    Hello Reddit Family,After scoring a 161 on my LSAT and having an undergrad GPA of a 3.87 at UCLA I’ve gotten accepted to Pepperdine Law School with a full scholarship, Southwestern Las School with a 50% tuition scholarship, and Loyola Law School with an unknown amount of scholarship money at this point, I’m thinking somewhere between 20k/yr and 40k/yr and been put on the UCLA waitlist(probably won’t get a dime if I get in). My goals for right after law school are to go work at an insurance company like Statefarm or Geico as a defense attorney. Here’s my question to you, what path will put me on the best route to reach my goal and make the best situation out of it? Would it be going to Loyola or Pepperdine or SW or UCLA(if I get in)? And if so what kinds of jobs come from mid tier schools?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "3779    Hello All,After going through the ordeal of applying to law school, I wanted to create a thread so I could offer some advice for those going through the process now or planning to. Particularly, I wanted to give advice from the point of view of someone who could not afford to spend much on LSAT/admission prep and who did not have any meaningful connections in the legal community. I was able to score a 177 on the Sep. LSAT and was admitted to Harvard. I am happy to answer any questions you all have about LSAT prep or any of the application components. I would also be happy to share  things that I wish I knew/was told before I started the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "3845    Hi everyone! I just got off the waitlist at Northwestern Law, but the email mentioned that no scholarship funding is available at this point. I'm wondering if anyone out there is paying sticker for law school and taking out loans for all of it \\(it'll be over 200k in student loans\\). Is it manageable? Any success stories? Thank you!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "4704    I applied in mid January and got waitlisted at several of my top choices this cycle. I was accepted to a couple schools that were in a similar tier, but I decided they weren't for me. Both schools gave me great scholarships, but I'm hoping I'll get a better response from my preferred choices once I get a consultant to help me with my application and apply as soon as I can (October 1st). All of the schools are Cali schools, so I know they get tons of applications, which is partly why I would like to reapply. When would be the best time to visit? Would a couple weeks after I apply be too soon? Asking because I'd like to combine my visits with a vacation :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "4742    Hi all! So I’ve been kind of lurking and low key posting here for a bit while trying to maintain a bit of anonymity but I have officially announced where I’m headed this fall and figured I’d post a cycle recap here! You can also find me as solennita on LSL and LSN!The basics: 3.74/173/nonKJD/nonURM (but a minority and discussed this in my PS and DS)My expectations were realistic for my stats (I thought) but I had a really amazing cycle that I just didn’t expect! The feedback I received (volunteered, I didn’t ask for it) from adcomms was that my essays and narrative set me apart. That’s mostly why I’m doing this- as an example of how important that part of an app can be, and to offer any advice based on my own background/experiences for prospective applicants!Y: Accepted, attendingH: AcceptedS: WaitlistCLS: Accepted w/ moneyNYU: Accepted w/ moneyUMich: Accepted w/ moneyDuke: Accepted w/ moneyUVA: WaitlistGeorgetown: WaitlistCongrats to everyone headed to LS this fall and wishing the best of luck for everyone applying in the next cycle!!   \n",

       "4870    Hey everyone I’m really new in my journey to law school, currently a sophomore in college and just started studying for the LSAT. I’ve been browsing this sub and others for content and I keep seeing people say they’ve got good softs? I get that they’re like things that look good on a resume or application, but like what are some examples? Like honor societies in college? Leadership positions? Volunteering? Honestly just trying to get the best app together that I can and still have to some too Thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "5104    I made my deposit and University of Michigan and strangely feel empty inside lol. Don’t know what doto obsess about and strive towards now. I guess it’s time to start obsessing about finishing in the top of my class so I can make that transfer to Yale. Good luck everyone who is still the the midst of it! P.S. Also my Hillflint sweater came in and it is sweet!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "439096  If you got a 176, I think Yale could be in play with your softs and being MA, but I don't think that NEEDS to be your goal, because you could have good outcomes with a lower score.I don't think GW is worth going to unless you want to do IP lit honestly. That's where their employment numbers come from. UCLA is going to be iffy because CA schools care about GPA more than LSAT, but if you get in it's not a bad option. WashU could be a good option if you get a good scholarship, which you could potentially. I wouldn't do Boston U if you aren't from Boston.I wouldn't go to Davis or Hastings. I'd sit out and retake.NYU would love you with a higher LSAT. If you retake, you'll also want to think about NU, which is super splitter friendly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "439175  I wouldn't worry about the LA quite yet, but I would consider working on a soft. I say just one because what a lot of schools love to see is commitment. Find a program you like, perhaps undergrad mooring or debating if available and get really good at it. Otherwise keep up the GPA :) good luck!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "439205  Agreeing with this. Your semester at a 4.0 is really the best thing you could've done so far for your law school hopes. If you maintain that through graduation, you have an opportunity to go almost anywhere you want provided you score in the 170s. I would advise you not to study for the LSAT just yet because as someone else mentioned, you don't want to burn through the best study materials just yet. More than anything, I'd say clutch onto that 4.0 GPA for dear life. It will benefit you massively in three years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "439358  How does the LSN get its information? Is it based on people plugging in their numbers?    The way I understand is that if Penn has 25% of their student body with a 164 LSAT score than OP's score of 169 puts him in a really good position if his application is decent. I get that it doesn't guarantee him a spot but I would think he would have a good chance of getting in.  Not trying to be a jerk just want to get a better understanding of the process                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "439468  This is true, but I'll note that Stanford's LSAT median raise was much more impressive than their GPA one, and they may have to be willing to take a GPA hit to keep it.

       "439473  You should look into aiming higher on the LSAT then a low 160s score. A high LSAT is your best way to improve your chances at attending a good school (definition: one that will help you get a full time job as a lawyer) for the right price (depends on the school and your goals). Law schools care about your GPA and your LSAT and that's basically it.You have a lot of time to study so put your all into it. Good luck!Taking time off to do the Peace Corps sounds like a great idea if you're passionate about it. In my opinion, everyone should get some kind of work/life experience between undergrad and law school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "439498  No problem. I think you will have great options! If you can get fee waivers there's no downside to tossing out a lot of apps and seeing what kind of money you can get out of the schools that admit you.

Nothing ventured, nothing gained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

For example:Boston UniversityRange of 152 - 180 and 2.46 - 4.05Boston CollegeRange of 159 - 164 and 3.32 - 3.64That's a bit of a drop from the numbers you have listed, and it holds true for most of the schools based on the data I pulled from their website when I did my own hunting.

A retake to 173 or 175 could give you great odds at Columbia and make you a lock for NYU, but wouldn't do a lot for Chicago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "440182  I don't believe I can get into G and am not wasting the application fee on them. GW, maybe, but even then it wouldn't be with a good aid package.(Even if I could do V, I do have a partner to consider and Cville is not conducive to his career, whereas he could be more flexible with large cities.)Again, I'm mostly throwing my hands up here.

       "440776  I'm fairly certain that schools can see whether you're registered for another LSAT administration, so they may already know about it.  Still, it's probably a good idea to inform them in an official email/letter of intent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "440782  I literally just did this yesterday. I took the SAT in 2007/08. My guidance department didn't have it on file but I was able to call the college board and have them reset my login username/password (I couldn't even remember the email I used in 2007). My scores were still listed on my account online. The application asking for my scores didn't need an official score report so I just wrote my highest score from each section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

You can definitely take the patent bar before law school, but that's a ton of prep just like the LSAT will be.Thanks and good luck to you too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "441351  Honestly, you should go into this assuming you have no advantage. Your GPA is your GPA, regardless of your major, that's the GPA that gets reported by the school on their incoming class profile, so that's the thing that matters. If you and an underwater basket weaving major had the exact same stats and GPA, you'd probably win out there, but you aren't going to win out against a Sociology major with a 3.3.Never fear though, you're above a 3.0 which is basically the 'floor' for most schools (even most T-14s), work on your LSAT, get a good score and apply like a good splitter. I'm a splitter too and I had a great cycle this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "413     Hello. I was hoping throughout this summer that GRE medians would be released for the handful of schools that accept the GRE; this, however, does not seem to be the case.Is there any hope this info will be released? I saw a couple of HLS admits with GRE scores, but they were all nearly perfect scores and several months ago, so it wasn't incredibly informative.Thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "772     I have all of the PowerScore bibles and I have the PTs 7,9-16,18. I have organized them on an excel sheet by LG type and LR type, which means that I have every question sorted out. However, it would require me flipping through pages if I want to drill. Is it best to just buy the PowerScore questions by type books, even though I have the questions (aprox $150 CAD) or does flipping through pages to drill still work well and provide the benefits of drilling? Looking for some suggestions here, thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

My question is- how come people don't link the UGPA/LSAT search calculator (where you enter GPA and LSAT and it shows you the probability of being admitted) provided on the LSAC website? Isn't that one more comprehensive and representative considering mylsn uses self-reported data?

I am trying to decide whether to apply with these numbers or retake the LSAT.Thanks everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "1468    Anyone heard from the admissions committee at SMU regarding getting off the waitlist? If anyone has any insight on my chances, or advice, I would greatly appreciate it! I know I'm running out of time but its my top school, and I'm willing to do anything. Also, do law schools notify you if you did not make it off the waitlist and into the upcoming class via email, or do they not tell you?

Any advice is welcome!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "2382    I go to LSU for undergrad. I am currently in a summer semester after my junior year, which would place me at a cumulative GPA of around 3.33. I had a horrid gpa my freshman year but every semester has been a 3.5-3.9 since then, and it’s rising about .1 every semester. Best case scenario, I graduate with around a 3.55. I haven’t taken the LSAT, and was planning on taking a year off to work and study for the LSAT. Assuming I do well on the LSAT, even though this is a big range, somewhere from 160-170, where would my options be? I’m in state in Maryland, and I know UMD isn’t the best but it’s certainly not a bad law school. My reach school would probably be UVA (I’m a legacy for the undergrad program, which I doubt has any pull). Where do I stand?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "3215    Hi everyone,Congratulations to everyone who has been accepted and starting in the fall! That’s awesome. I had some questions about prep courses. I plan on taking the LSAT in September and was wondering if prep courses are worth it. I’d have about 3 months to study. I’ve been going through the books from Powersource that I purchased from a friend, but they don’t seem to be doing a lot for me. I’ve heard a lot about LSATMax, Kaplan, Princeton review, testmasters and so on. I was wondering if any of you had experiences with these online prep courses and what those experiences consisted of. Would one of these make a significant impact in 3 months?Thank you in advance for any advice and light you all can shed on the issue!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "3565    Hello Reddit Family,After scoring a 161 on my LSAT and having an undergrad GPA of a 3.87 at UCLA I’ve gotten accepted to Pepperdine Law School with a full scholarship, Southwestern Las School with a 50% tuition scholarship, and Loyola Law School with an unknown amount of scholarship money at this point, I’m thinking somewhere between 20k/yr and 40k/yr and been put on the UCLA waitlist(probably won’t get a dime if I get in). My goals for right after law school are to go work at an insurance company like Statefarm or Geico as a defense attorney. Here’s my question to you, what path will put me on the best route to reach my goal and make the best situation out of it? Would it be going to Loyola or Pepperdine or SW or UCLA(if I get in)? And if so what kinds of jobs come from mid tier schools?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "3779    Hello All,After going through the ordeal of applying to law school, I wanted to create a thread so I could offer some advice for those going through the process now or planning to. Particularly, I wanted to give advice from the point of view of someone who could not afford to spend much on LSAT/admission prep and who did not have any meaningful connections in the legal community. I was able to score a 177 on the Sep. LSAT and was admitted to Harvard. I am happy to answer any questions you all have about LSAT prep or any of the application components. I would also be happy to share  things that I wish I knew/was told before I started the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "3845    Hi everyone! I just got off the waitlist at Northwestern Law, but the email mentioned that no scholarship funding is available at this point. I'm wondering if anyone out there is paying sticker for law school and taking out loans for all of it \\(it'll be over 200k in student loans\\). Is it manageable? Any success stories? Thank you!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "4704    I applied in mid January and got waitlisted at several of my top choices this cycle. I was accepted to a couple schools that were in a similar tier, but I decided they weren't for me. Both schools gave me great scholarships, but I'm hoping I'll get a better response from my preferred choices once I get a consultant to help me with my application and apply as soon as I can (October 1st). All of the schools are Cali schools, so I know they get tons of applications, which is partly why I would like to reapply. When would be the best time to visit? Would a couple weeks after I apply be too soon? Asking because I'd like to combine my visits with a vacation :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "4742    Hi all! So I’ve been kind of lurking and low key posting here for a bit while trying to maintain a bit of anonymity but I have officially announced where I’m headed this fall and figured I’d post a cycle recap here! You can also find me as solennita on LSL and LSN!The basics: 3.74/173/nonKJD/nonURM (but a minority and discussed this in my PS and DS)My expectations were realistic for my stats (I thought) but I had a really amazing cycle that I just didn’t expect! The feedback I received (volunteered, I didn’t ask for it) from adcomms was that my essays and narrative set me apart. That’s mostly why I’m doing this- as an example of how important that part of an app can be, and to offer any advice based on my own background/experiences for prospective applicants!Y: Accepted, attendingH: AcceptedS: WaitlistCLS: Accepted w/ moneyNYU: Accepted w/ moneyUMich: Accepted w/ moneyDuke: Accepted w/ moneyUVA: WaitlistGeorgetown: WaitlistCongrats to everyone headed to LS this fall and wishing the best of luck for everyone applying in the next cycle!!   \n",

       "4870    Hey everyone I’m really new in my journey to law school, currently a sophomore in college and just started studying for the LSAT. I’ve been browsing this sub and others for content and I keep seeing people say they’ve got good softs? I get that they’re like things that look good on a resume or application, but like what are some examples? Like honor societies in college? Leadership positions? Volunteering? Honestly just trying to get the best app together that I can and still have to some too Thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "5104    I made my deposit and University of Michigan and strangely feel empty inside lol. Don’t know what doto obsess about and strive towards now. I guess it’s time to start obsessing about finishing in the top of my class so I can make that transfer to Yale. Good luck everyone who is still the the midst of it! P.S. Also my Hillflint sweater came in and it is sweet!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "439096  If you got a 176, I think Yale could be in play with your softs and being MA, but I don't think that NEEDS to be your goal, because you could have good outcomes with a lower score.I don't think GW is worth going to unless you want to do IP lit honestly. That's where their employment numbers come from. UCLA is going to be iffy because CA schools care about GPA more than LSAT, but if you get in it's not a bad option. WashU could be a good option if you get a good scholarship, which you could potentially. I wouldn't do Boston U if you aren't from Boston.I wouldn't go to Davis or Hastings. I'd sit out and retake.NYU would love you with a higher LSAT. If you retake, you'll also want to think about NU, which is super splitter friendly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "439175  I wouldn't worry about the LA quite yet, but I would consider working on a soft. I say just one because what a lot of schools love to see is commitment. Find a program you like, perhaps undergrad mooring or debating if available and get really good at it. Otherwise keep up the GPA :) good luck!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "439205  Agreeing with this. Your semester at a 4.0 is really the best thing you could've done so far for your law school hopes. If you maintain that through graduation, you have an opportunity to go almost anywhere you want provided you score in the 170s. I would advise you not to study for the LSAT just yet because as someone else mentioned, you don't want to burn through the best study materials just yet. More than anything, I'd say clutch onto that 4.0 GPA for dear life. It will benefit you massively in three years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "439358  How does the LSN get its information? Is it based on people plugging in their numbers?    The way I understand is that if Penn has 25% of their student body with a 164 LSAT score than OP's score of 169 puts him in a really good position if his application is decent. I get that it doesn't guarantee him a spot but I would think he would have a good chance of getting in.  Not trying to be a jerk just want to get a better understanding of the process                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "439468  This is true, but I'll note that Stanford's LSAT median raise was much more impressive than their GPA one, and they may have to be willing to take a GPA hit to keep it.

       "439473  You should look into aiming higher on the LSAT then a low 160s score. A high LSAT is your best way to improve your chances at attending a good school (definition: one that will help you get a full time job as a lawyer) for the right price (depends on the school and your goals). Law schools care about your GPA and your LSAT and that's basically it.You have a lot of time to study so put your all into it. Good luck!Taking time off to do the Peace Corps sounds like a great idea if you're passionate about it. In my opinion, everyone should get some kind of work/life experience between undergrad and law school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "439498  No problem. I think you will have great options! If you can get fee waivers there's no downside to tossing out a lot of apps and seeing what kind of money you can get out of the schools that admit you.

Nothing ventured, nothing gained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

For example:Boston UniversityRange of 152 - 180 and 2.46 - 4.05Boston CollegeRange of 159 - 164 and 3.32 - 3.64That's a bit of a drop from the numbers you have listed, and it holds true for most of the schools based on the data I pulled from their website when I did my own hunting.

A retake to 173 or 175 could give you great odds at Columbia and make you a lock for NYU, but wouldn't do a lot for Chicago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "440182  I don't believe I can get into G and am not wasting the application fee on them. GW, maybe, but even then it wouldn't be with a good aid package.(Even if I could do V, I do have a partner to consider and Cville is not conducive to his career, whereas he could be more flexible with large cities.)Again, I'm mostly throwing my hands up here.

       "440776  I'm fairly certain that schools can see whether you're registered for another LSAT administration, so they may already know about it.  Still, it's probably a good idea to inform them in an official email/letter of intent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "440782  I literally just did this yesterday. I took the SAT in 2007/08. My guidance department didn't have it on file but I was able to call the college board and have them reset my login username/password (I couldn't even remember the email I used in 2007). My scores were still listed on my account online. The application asking for my scores didn't need an official score report so I just wrote my highest score from each section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

You can definitely take the patent bar before law school, but that's a ton of prep just like the LSAT will be.Thanks and good luck to you too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "441351  Honestly, you should go into this assuming you have no advantage. Your GPA is your GPA, regardless of your major, that's the GPA that gets reported by the school on their incoming class profile, so that's the thing that matters. If you and an underwater basket weaving major had the exact same stats and GPA, you'd probably win out there, but you aren't going to win out against a Sociology major with a 3.3.Never fear though, you're above a 3.0 which is basically the 'floor' for most schools (even most T-14s), work on your LSAT, get a good score and apply like a good splitter. I'm a splitter too and I had a great cycle this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
